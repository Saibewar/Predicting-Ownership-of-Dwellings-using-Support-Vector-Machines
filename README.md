Predicting Ownership of Dwellings using Support Vector Machines

In the current market conditions, both renting and owning real estate will have an impact in the long run. And understanding real estate needs and trends becomes critical for policymakers as well as consumers. Therefore, it is essential to investigate both short-term and long-term market trends in order to arrive at a well-informed decision. Understanding supply and demand plays a crucial role in determining housing needs, as the market is heading into a recession. Thus it becomes imperative to develop an algorithm that accurately predicts the ownership of a dwelling. This research uses data from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS USA) to perform analysis and examine the accuracy of Support Vector Machines in predicting whether a dwelling is occupied by an owner or renter. Three models were developed using linear, polynomial, and radial kernels of SVM to understand the influential factors and thereby make predictions. The first model using linear kernel was able to classify the ownership of a dwelling as owner or renter with a test error rate of 13.8%. The second model using a polynomial kernel was able to classify the dwellingâ€™s ownership as owner or renter with a test error rate of 12.3%. The third model using a radial kernel resulted in a test error rate of 13.4%.
